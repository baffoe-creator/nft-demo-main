Welcome to the GitHub Repository for Simple and Advanced NFTs with Solidity! 

This repository contains the code for creating, managing and trading NFTs using Solidity. The code is divided into two sections, one for Simple NFTs and one for Advanced NFTs. 

The Simple NFTs section contains the code for creating, managing and trading a single type of NFT. The Advanced NFTs section contains the code for creating, managing and trading multiple types of NFTs. 
I hope you find this repository useful in creating your own NFTs with Solidity! Please feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback.

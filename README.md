# NFT Smart Contract Repository
This repository contains the code for Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Smart Contracts written in Solidity and Javascript. The code is divided into two sections: Simple NFTs and Advanced NFTs.

## Simple NFTs
The Simple NFTs section contains basic implementations of NFTs, such as a basic ERC721 contract and a contract for a single type of NFT.

## Advanced NFTs
The Advanced NFTs section contains more complex implementations of NFTs, such as a multi-owner ERC721 contract and a contract for multiple types of NFTs.

## Tests
Unit and integration tests are conducted on the code in this repository to ensure that the contracts are operating as expected.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to this repository. If you have suggestions or improvements, please open an issue or pull request.
